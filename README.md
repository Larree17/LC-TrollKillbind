This is the GitHub page for TrollKillbind, a modified version of KillBind by Confusified. The original mod can be found below:
https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Confusified/KillBind/
https://github.com/Confusified/LC-KillBind/

I don't know much about programming in C# (or github), so this is meant to be a very basic edit to cause the killbind to only work sometimes (randomly). Please work üôè
